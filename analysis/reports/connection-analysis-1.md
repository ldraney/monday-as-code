### Deprecated Board Still In Use

- **Decision Needed:** Are these production test environments or safe to archive?

## üìä Cleanup Impact Analysis

### Immediate Cleanup Potential
- **Low Risk Archive:** 35-40 boards (meeting boards, obvious test boards, duplicates)
- **Medium Risk Archive:** 10-15 boards (standalone operational boards)
- **Subitem Cleanup:** 40 auto-generated subitem boards

### Projected Results After Cleanup
- **Before:** 82 boards (29 connected, 53 orphaned)
- **After Cleanup:** ~30-35 boards (29 connected, 1-6 under review)
- **Cleanup Ratio:** 60-70% reduction in board count

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Low Risk)
1. **Archive meeting boards** - No connections, administrative only
2. **Archive duplicate boards** - "Duplicate of Compounding Schedule"
3. **Archive obvious test boards** - "New Board", "Test Board from Code"
4. **Archive standalone admin boards** - Action items, Meeting summary

### Phase 2: Review and Archive (Medium Risk)  
1. **Review "Purchasing (deprecated)"** - Migrate 4 connections first
2. **Review production boards** - Production (Bulk), Production Calendar 2024
3. **Review TODO boards** - Check if actively used

### Phase 3: Subitem Cleanup (Bulk Operation)
1. **Archive 40 orphaned subitem boards** - Mass operation
2. **Keep 4 connected subitem boards** - They're being used

### Phase 4: Cross-Workspace Analysis
1. **Export Production workspace** - Compare connections
2. **Export CRM workspace** - Map customer data flow  
3. **Identify cross-workspace connections** - Full ecosystem view

## üìã State Management
