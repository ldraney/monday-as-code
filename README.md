# Monday as Code 🚀

> Infrastructure as Code for Monday.com - Workspace management, board discovery, and systematic cleanup

## 🎯 **Current Status - Phase 2B: State Management & Cleanup Implementation**

### **✅ Completed - Phase 1 & 2A**
- [x] **Infrastructure Discovery** - Can export Monday.com boards to JSON configs
- [x] **Connection Analysis** - Successfully analyzed 82 boards in Lab workspace
- [x] **Clear Insights** - Identified 29 connected vs 53 orphaned boards
- [x] **State Framework** - Basic state management scripts created

### **🔥 Current Focus - Phase 2B: Board Cleanup System**

**Goal**: Build safe, reversible cleanup system to reduce Lab workspace from 82 boards to ~35 boards

## 📊 **Discovery Results - Lab Workspace Analysis**

**Lab Workspace (ID: 9736208):**
- **82 total boards** discovered (much more than expected!)
- **29 connected boards** (35%) - Core business workflows  
- **53 orphaned boards** (65%) - Major cleanup opportunity

### **Core Workflow Boards (Keep These)**
| Board | Connections | Role |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Development | 18 | 🏆 Most connected - Core operations |
| Accounts | 14 | 🏢 CRM hub |
| Prod Deals | 10 | 💰 Sales pipeline |
| Production | 10 | 🏭 Manufacturing |
| Projects | 9 | 📋 Project management |

### **Cleanup Candidates (53 boards)**
- **Immediate safe archive**: Meeting boards, duplicates, test boards (~15 boards)
- **Review required**: "Purchasing (deprecated)" still has 4 connections
- **Bulk cleanup**: 40+ orphaned "Subitems of..." boards (auto-generated)

```

## 🚀 **Quick Start - Current Working Commands**

### **Connection Analysis** (Working)
```bash
# Analyze board connections in Lab workspace
./scripts/simple-analyzer.sh

# View results
cat analysis/simple/lab_analysis.json
```

### **State Management** (Needs Testing)
```bash
# Capture current state
./scripts/manage-state.sh capture-current

# Show current status
./scripts/manage-state.sh show-current

# Create desired state for cleanup planning
./scripts/manage-state.sh create-desired --workspace lab

# Compare current vs desired
./scripts/manage-state.sh compare
```

### **Board Export** (Rate Limited - Use Carefully)
```bash
# Export other workspaces (with caution - rate limits)
./scripts/discover-monday.sh export-boards --workspace-id 519072    # Production
./scripts/discover-monday.sh export-boards --workspace-id 11007618  # CRM
```

## 📋 **Phase 2B Roadmap - Board Cleanup System**

### **Step 1: State Management** (In Progress)
- [x] Create state management framework
- [ ] Test state capture and tracking
- [ ] Generate cleanup action plans
- [ ] Track progress over time

### **Step 2: Safe Archival System** (Next)
- [ ] Board backup system (complete structure + data)
- [ ] Safe archive process (rename with [ARCHIVED] prefix)
- [ ] Restore capability for archived boards
- [ ] Audit trail of all cleanup actions

### **Step 3: Cleanup Workflow** (Priority Order)
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Archive safe candidates (meetings, duplicates) - ~15 boards
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Handle "Purchasing (deprecated)" with connections
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Bulk archive orphaned subitem boards - ~40 boards
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Review remaining orphaned boards

### **Step 4: Cross-Workspace Analysis** (Future)
- [ ] Export Production workspace (with rate limiting)
- [ ] Export CRM workspace (with rate limiting)  
- [ ] Map cross-workspace connections
- [ ] Full ecosystem cleanup strategy

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

**Immediate Goal (Lab Workspace)**:
- **From**: 82 boards (29 connected, 53 orphaned)
- **To**: ~35 boards (29+ connected, <5 orphaned)
- **Cleanup**: 60-70% reduction in board count
- **Safety**: 100% restore capability for archived boards

## ⚡ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
# Required tools
brew install jq curl  # macOS
sudo apt-get install jq curl  # Ubuntu

# Set API token
export MONDAY_API_TOKEN='your_token_here'
```

### **Test Current System**
```bash
# Test connection analysis (safe - no API calls)
./scripts/simple-analyzer.sh

# Test state management (needs verification)
./scripts/manage-state.sh capture-current
./scripts/manage-state.sh show-current
```

## 📊 **Analysis Files Generated**

### **Connection Analysis**
- `analysis/simple/lab_analysis.json` - Raw analysis data
- `reports/lab_connection_report.md` - Detailed markdown report

### **State Management**  
- `state/current/latest.json` - Current infrastructure state
- `state/desired/lab_desired_state.json` - Target cleanup goals
- `state/plans/cleanup_action_plan_*.md` - Step-by-step cleanup plans

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

### **Built-in Safeguards**
- **No destructive operations** without explicit confirmation
- **Complete backup** before any board changes
- **Restore capability** for all archived boards
- **Rate limiting** to avoid Monday.com API limits
- **Dry-run mode** for all cleanup operations

### **Audit Trail**
- All operations logged with timestamps
- Board structure backups stored permanently  
- Restore commands documented for each archived board

## 🤝 **Contributing & Next Steps**

**Current Development**: Phase 2B - State management and board cleanup implementation

**How to Help**:
1. Test state management scripts and report issues
2. Help implement safe board archival system
3. Build cleanup workflow with proper rate limiting
4. Create visual dashboards for cleanup progress

**Architecture**: Bash scripts + jq for JSON processing + Monday.com GraphQL API

---

**Phase 2B Focus**: Building safe, systematic board cleanup with full restore capability  
**Vision**: Clean, organized Monday.com infrastructure managed as code
