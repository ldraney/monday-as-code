# Monday as Code 🚀

> Infrastructure as Code for Monday.com - Workspace management, board discovery, and connection mapping

## 🎯 **Current Status - Phase 2: Connection Discovery**

### **✅ Completed - Infrastructure Discovery & State Capture**
- [x] **Workspace-based architecture** - Lab, Production, CRM environments
- [x] **Complete state discovery** - 38 boards exported from Lab workspace
- [x] **JSON-based board definitions** with deployable configurations
- [x] **State management system** - tracks boards across workspaces
- [x] **Rate-limit safe discovery** - handles Monday.com API constraints
- [x] **Modular repository structure** - organized by workspace + cross-cutting concerns

### **🔥 Current Focus - Connection Mapping & Board Cleanup**

**Goal**: Create a complete map of board connections starting from CRM, identify unused boards for archival.

## 🔍 **Discovery System - Complete**

### **Workspace Discovery**
```bash
# Discovered three key workspaces
Lab:        9736208  # 38 boards exported ✅
Production: 519072   # Ready for export
CRM:        11007618 # Ready for export
```

### **Board Export**
```bash
# Export boards from each workspace
./scripts/discover-monday.sh export-boards --workspace-id 9736208   # ✅ Done
./scripts/discover-monday.sh export-boards --workspace-id 519072    # Next
./scripts/discover-monday.sh export-boards --workspace-id 11007618  # Next
```

## 🔗 **Next Phase: Connection Mapping Strategy**

### **Connection Discovery Plan**
1. **Start from CRM** - Customer data is the source of truth
2. **Trace connections** - CRM → connected boards → boards connected to those
3. **Build connection graph** - Visual diagram of workspace relationships
4. **Classify boards**:
   - **Connected** = Active (part of workflows)
   - **Disconnected** = Archive candidates
   - **Deprecated** = Special handling needed

### **Board Cleanup Strategy**
```bash
# Future commands (to be built)
./scripts/analyze-connections.sh --start-from crm
./scripts/map-board-graph.sh --export-diagram
./scripts/classify-boards.sh --identify-orphans
./scripts/archive-manager.sh --archive-unused --with-restore
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Commands (Working)**

```bash
# Environment-specific deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh apply --env lab
./scripts/deploy.sh apply --env production  
./scripts/deploy.sh apply --env crm

# State management
./scripts/state-manager.sh refresh --env lab
./scripts/state-manager.sh show --env lab

# Discovery
./scripts/discover-monday.sh scan-workspace --workspace-id 9736208
./scripts/discover-monday.sh export-boards --workspace-id 9736208
```

## 💡 **Key Insights from Phase 1**

### **Workspace Architecture**
- **Three core environments** mapped to actual Monday.com workspaces
- **Modular approach** enables team ownership (Lab team, Operations team, Sales team)
- **Cross-workspace connections** require special handling module

### **Board Management Scale**
- **38 boards in Lab alone** - significant cleanup opportunity
- **Many test/experimental boards** - candidates for archival
- **Connection-driven approach** - only keep boards that are part of active workflows

### **API Discovery Learnings**
- **Rate limits** require careful sequencing (solved)
- **Hidden workspaces** exist that don't show in general queries (solved)
- **JSON export** enables version control and deployment (working)

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Complete board exports** - Production + CRM workspaces
2. **Build connection mapper** - Start from CRM, trace all connections
3. **Generate connection diagram** - Visual map of board relationships  
4. **Identify cleanup candidates** - Disconnected/unused boards
5. **Design archival system** - Safe cleanup with restore capability

## 🧰 **Technical Foundation**

### **Proven Stack**
- `curl` + `jq` - Monday.com API integration
- JSON configs - Deployable board definitions
- Bash scripts - Cross-platform automation
- State files - Change tracking and planning

### **API Integration** 
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.monday.com/v2`
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in delays and error handling
- **Cross-workspace**: Supports boards across multiple workspaces
- **GraphQL**: Efficient data retrieval
